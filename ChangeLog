2009-02-22  Philip Withnall  <philip@tecnocode.co.uk>

	Improved documentation (README, ChangeLog).

2009-02-21  Philip Withnall  <philip@tecnocode.co.uk>

	Added support for querying for related videos and fixed a bug parsing
	<yt:statistics/>.

2009-02-20  Philip Withnall  <philip@tecnocode.co.uk>

	Completed functionality to upload videos to YouTube. There are a few
	elements in the response which are still unparsed, but the tests in
	the suite work.

2009-02-11  Philip Withnall  <philip@tecnocode.co.uk>

	Removed generated file.

2009-01-25  Philip Withnall  <philip@tecnocode.co.uk>

	Initial support for inserting entries, mainly adding functionality to
	serialise GDataEntry and GDataYouTubeVideo to XML.

2009-01-24  Philip Withnall  <philip@tecnocode.co.uk>

	Converted all async functions to use GAsyncResult, and implemented
	overridden versions for YouTubeVideo. Added testcases, and generally
	made sure all current async functionality works nicely.

	Fixed a small bug when parsing <media:credit> elements.

2009-01-24  Philip Withnall  <philip@tecnocode.co.uk>

	Consolidated the MediaGroup classes into YouTubeVideo, since that was
	the only class which would ever use them.

2009-01-23  Philip Withnall  <philip@tecnocode.co.uk>

	Redesigned how feeds are parsed such that there is no longer any need
	for public setters, and there should be fewer memcpys.

2009-01-23  Philip Withnall  <philip@tecnocode.co.uk>

	Added mostly-complete support for video comments.

2009-01-22  Philip Withnall  <philip@tecnocode.co.uk>

	Cleaned up parsing of numbers a little, and cleaned up parsing error
	handling. Also tidied up feed creation, and removed the now-redundant
	GDataYouTubeVideoFeed object.

2009-01-22  Philip Withnall  <philip@tecnocode.co.uk>

	Added basic async support, and greatly expanded the parsing code such
	that almost all of a typical YouTube GData query is now parsed into
	datastructures.

2009-01-03  Philip Withnall  <philip@tecnocode.co.uk>

	Initial commit, with basic functional queries for YouTube and the
	generic GData API. No async support, and limited support for lots
	of the XML elements.
