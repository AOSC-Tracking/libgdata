 * @short_description: GData access handler interface
 * @stability: Unstable
 * @include: gdata/gdata-access-handler.h
 *
 * #GDataAccessHandler is an interface which can be implemented by #GDataEntry<!-- -->s which can have their permissions controlled by an
 * access control list (ACL). It has a set of methods which allow the #GDataAccessRule<!-- -->s for the access handler/entry to be retrieved,
 * added, modified and deleted, with immediate effect.
 *
 * When implementing the interface, classes must implement an <function>is_owner_rule</function> function.
 *
 * Since: 0.3.0
