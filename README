libgdata
========

libgdata is a GLib-based library for accessing online service APIs using the
GData protocol --- most notably, Google's services. It provides APIs to access
the common Google services, and has full asynchronous support.

See the test programs in gdata/tests/ for simple examples of how to use the
code.

libgdata's API is currently unstable and is likely to change wildly.
